<h3>This map shows the counties in Ireland colored by the percentage of 
    the population that can speak Irish, also known as Gaelige. The map uses the Quantile categorization mode. This was an 
area of interest for me because both of my parents immigrated to the United States from Ireland.
speaking Gaelige was outlawed by the British the fourteenth century and the use of the language 
has been dissapearing since. Although in recent decades the Irish government has made an effort to
teach Gaelige in schools and preserve the language, use in private households is still very low
and Gaelige is considered an endangered language.</h3>
