    <h3>This map intends to show the accessibility of New York City high 
        schools through public transport. In order to do this, I decided to
        categorize high schools by if they were within a 10 minute walk, or 
        half a mile, of a subway stop. In order to do this, first I imported 
        a shapefile of Subway Lines and Subway Stops in New York City. Then,
        I imported a CSV of public high schools from the Department of Education,
        with Longitude and Latitude information. I created an 800 meter buffer 
        around the high schools and took the intersection of schools within the
        buffers, shown in orange. We can see the high schools without subway 
        access are largely in the outer boroughs, including far Queens, Brookyln,
        and all high schools in Staten Island, which lacks a subway.
